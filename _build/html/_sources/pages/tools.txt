Deal alias generator
--------------------

Before version 1.2.0, there was no sharing feature. Since 1.2.0 we can share deals to social networks. To be able to share deals, we need to have deal alias. This tool help you create deal alias automatically based on deal title.

If you upgrade from a version older than 1.2.0, you need to run this tool at least once to generate aliases for your existing deals.
